* Overview
This is a copy of the [[http://www.gradle.org/docs/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html][Gradle wrapper]] ported for use with [[http://maven.apache.org][Apache Maven]]. =maven-wrapper= is available from [[http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.rimerosolutions.maven.plugins%22][Maven Central]].

The Maven Command Line Wrapper will auto-download and install Apache Maven from the Internet and then run your Maven goals.
=maven-wrapper= ships as Maven plugin that generates wrapper scripts and a configuration file to bootstrap Maven download and installation.

** Rationale
This is a fork of [[https://github.com/bdemers/maven-wrapper][bdemers' maven-wrapper]] in order to provide the Maven Wrapper as a Maven plugin, for more flexible reuse/integration. Once you have a Maven project that you want to distribute, you can generate a wrapper so that:

- The target audience can easily execute Maven goals without an existing Maven application as a pre-requisite.
- You can control the version of Maven that is to be used to build the project, if are versions compatibility concerns.

** Integration example

For a full and small practical integration example, checkout the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/maven-wrapper-example][Maven Command Line Wrapper Example]] project.

If you used to run

 : mvn clean install

Then you would now run (without a leading =./= for MS Windows)
 : ./mvnw clean install
	
A wrapper created with Maven 3.0.4 will request Maven 3.0.4, if it's not already installed on the user's machine.
However, you can still request a specific Maven version by overriding the default behaviour (Maven plugin configuration).

Notes: You need a valid JDK at least 1.6. The plugin was tested with Maven 3.0.2 and above.

* Maven Goals and Usage
For the list of goals and a usage guide, please consult the [[https://github.com/rimerosolutions/maven-wrapper/wiki][Wiki]].
	
* Generating the Maven wrapper
After integrating the wrapper into your Maven project (plugin section), run the following command to generate the wrapper.

 : mvn wrapper:wrapper

The =mvnw= and =mwnw.bat= command wrappers are generated at the root of the project folder.
	
The =maven= folder is generated with the relevant jar and properties file in the project directory.

You can now start using either the =mvnw= or =mvnw.bat= commands on any project without an existing maven installation!
